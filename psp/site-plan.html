      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>What makes a good story?
        With that question in mind, I have created a story that could be part of the favorite 
        list of many people around the world.
        This website contains the plot summary, character biographies, important scenes, 
        geography, and soundtracks.
        On the header of this site, you will find each section mentioned as well as the page 
        to contribute to this project. We will not ask for a specific value, you can donate 
        with our hearths content.
        Since we only have the story, we still are open to feedback on what we can do with 
        it. We have plans to make a videogame, or make a film, or even a stream platform 
        series.
        After  seeing  our  story  and  all  the  resources  we  already  have,  if  you  decide  to 
        contribute, we will put your name on the Credits of the final product.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Animation or Gaming Design Companies. I want to have this website as a portfolio so I can easily
          share all the concepts of this idea to any company interested in using this story in their future projects. 
          It is also a good way for me to organize this idea for my own future usage. My real intention is to give life
          to this story myself, so we can say that I am one of the intended audiences.

      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>
        Plot Summary<br>

In a suspicious world that resembles the Earth, a story about science fiction and afterlife takes place. The world setting is that every city has boundaries and heavy guarding. The reason for it is that there are monsters wandering around the earth, and most of them are aggressive towards humans. The origin of those monsters is something that is been treated as a top secret from the government, as if their origin should not be known for the people`s sake.
We first are presented to a group of four main protagonists: Saju, Kashi, Vito, and Mizo. They are all 19 years old, finishing the summer camp of their last year in high school. During the camping, they are attacked by a pair of magical creatures that almost put them to death. They are found by the other school mates and taken to the hospital. After some months recovering, they are finally free to go home, and they gather in one of the character’s houses to talk about the incident. During the talk, one of the characters could remember a lot of details, saying some of the things the creatures have said to them.
We then go into an adventure with the protagonists to find answers about the creatures, and other mysteries that are presented during the first episodes.
Prepare to embark on a journey full of epic battles, superpowers, unravels, new worlds and more.

      <h3>Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Saju<br>
Saju is the leader of the four main protagonists. In his childhood, Saju’s mother put him on a martial art dojo, so he could learn how to protect himself. Since the story is RPG oriented, we can say that Saju is the grappler of the party, having a well-rounded stat tree, and the best defense of the four. His personality is (). He loves to fight, and frequently put the party in danger for not having fears.
<br><br>
Kashi<br>
Kashi was abandoned by his parents when he was a baby, probably due to financial crisis. He was left on a church`s door and raised for a couple of years by a priest. That church was soon plundered and the bishop got killed by one of the robbers. The gang`s leader found Kashi and decided to take him. Kashi then spent the rest of his childhood and most of his teenage as a member of a thieves gang, but decided to leave and leave on his own after gathering some money. The reason for this change of hearth was due to what happened on one of his missions. Kashi was charged with a mission to climb one of the city`s tallest mountains, to find a rare bird (creature) nest and steal one of its eggs. Kashi managed to find and reach the nest, but he was then attacked by the birds’ mother, and Kashi ended up losing the sight of one of his eyes from the bird`s attack. That experience made him remember the teachings of the late priest, so he decided to give up theft. Interesting enough, the gang was not that bad at all. The gang taught Kashi most of the school`s material equivalent to what would happen in a elementary school for his age, so Kashi was a smart kid. Kashi then decided to apply for a ordinary high school, and there was when he met Saju and the others. For the RPG`s sake, Kashi is the “thief class. He has the highest speed status of the four.
<br><br>
Vito<br>
Vito is a son of a rich family that, when reaching adulthood, asked to live on his own. He has his own house with maidens and butlers. All his spendings are covered by his parents, so he never had to worry about money.
